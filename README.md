# Bike Sharing Data Analysis Dashboard

This is a final project from Dicoding in the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course to make analysis and create a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. It includes code for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration. This project aims to analyze data on the Bike Sharing Dataset.

## Setup Environment
1. Create a directory for your project:
    ```bash
   mkdir proyek_analisis_data
   cd proyek_analisis_data

2. install pipenv for managing dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pipenv
   
3. initialize the project with pipenv:
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   
6. Install all necessary dependencies from requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run Streamlit App
Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit dashboard using the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
